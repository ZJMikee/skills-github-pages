Stars are massive celestial objects composed primarily of hydrogen and helium that produce energy through nuclear fusion in their cores. This fusion process powers stars, creating heat and light that radiate into space. Here are some key points about stars:

Formation
Stars form in vast clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae.
Gravity causes regions within the nebula to collapse, forming a dense core that heats up as it contracts.
When the core temperature reaches about 10 million degrees Celsius, nuclear fusion begins, marking the birth of a star.
